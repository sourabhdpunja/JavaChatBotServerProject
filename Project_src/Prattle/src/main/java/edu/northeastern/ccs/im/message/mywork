Intergalactic Dashboard

 This was a new project where the requirement was to give the clients, targeted mainly to upper management like VP, Team manager etc, reporting information. This had information like how often are the call center agents or supervisors using the cogito application, how are performance scores(CX scores) of the call center agents. These can be based on different criteria’s like sites, team or timeframe. I worked on a mix of client side and server side of the application. In the server side, I worked on creating some of the API endpoint layer and business layer(service layer) . This required accepting http request’s from the client, processing the request, obtaining the result from database and giving the result back to client. These requests involved mainly querying information like getting the number of logins for an agent of a particular site or in a particular date range. After obtaining the result through querying using a SQL statement, I processed it in a such a way that the data is correctly parsed and formatted
